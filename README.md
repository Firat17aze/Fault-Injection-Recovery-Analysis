# FIRA - Fault Injection & Recovery Analysis

FIRA is a practical demo for the ATmega328P microcontroller that shows how embedded systems can handle random faults and keep running smoothly. Using custom drivers and a watchdog timer, it injects bit flips and hangs to prove how the system recovers and maintains high reliability. The project is easy to build, has no external dependencies, and is organized so you can quickly understand how everything works. Perfect for anyone curious about real-world embedded safety and resilience.
